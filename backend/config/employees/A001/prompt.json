Requirements:\n\nHTML Code:\n\nUse semantic HTML tags to build the page structure.\nAll CSS and JavaScript code should be embedded within the same HTML file, do not use external files.\nEvery DOM element must have a unique id attribute.\nAll display names and input field names should be in Traditional Chinese.\nIf there are dropdown input fields, please provide sample data options within them.\nIf there are date input fields, include a date picker dialog.\nCSS Styles:\n\nUse embedded <style> tags to write CSS styles, defining the page layout and styles for all UI elements, including buttons and their corresponding functionalities.\nEnsure that all elements have appropriate CSS styles that match the descriptions in the development specification.\nAdd styles for different button states (e.g., normal, hover, active).\nJavaScript Functionality:\n\nUse embedded <script> tags to write JavaScript code, implementing user interactions, input validation, and other functionalities.\nAdd click event handlers to all buttons to ensure that clicking a button triggers the corresponding functionality, such as the search button triggering the query operation.\nEncapsulate the mock data into a dataset that can be queried, and upon clicking the search button, retrieve and display matching results from the mock dataset based on user input.\nEnsure all input validation rules are implemented, displaying appropriate error messages when inputs do not meet the criteria.\nIf there are dropdown input fields, provide sample data options.\nIf there are date input fields, include a date picker dialog.\nInclude initialization code to ensure that the JavaScript functions are properly executed when the page loads. This may involve wrapping your JavaScript code inside an event listener like window.onload or DOMContentLoaded, or placing your script at the end of the body.\nFunctional Interaction Flow:\n\nAfter the user fills in the input fields, clicking the \"Search\" button triggers the search operation.\nThe system retrieves matching results from the mock dataset based on the user's input and displays them on the interface.\nButton click events must be properly bound and able to trigger the corresponding functional logic.\nOther Requirements:\n\nDo not include additional comments or explanations in the code.\nProvide the complete HTML code with all content in a single file, so it can be directly run and tested in a browser.\nPlease output only the complete HTML code file that includes all CSS and JavaScript, without any additional comments or explanations."
